Demonstration of main Pandas methods\nWell... There are dozens of cool tutorials on Pandas and visual data analysis. If you are already familiar with these topics, you can wait for the 3rd article in the series, where we get into machine learning.  \n\n**[Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)** is a Python library that provides extensive means for data analysis. Data scientists often work with data stored in table formats like `.csv`, `.tsv`, or `.xlsx`. Pandas makes it very convenient to load, process, and analyze such tabular data using SQL-like queries. In conjunction with `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`, `Pandas` provides a wide range of opportunities for visual analysis of tabular data.\n\nThe main data structures in `Pandas` are implemented with **Series** and **DataFrame** classes. The former is a one-dimensional indexed array of some fixed data type. The latter is a two-dimensional data structure - a table - where each column contains data of the same type. You can see it as a dictionary of `Series` instances. `DataFrames` are great for representing real data: rows correspond to instances (examples, observations, etc.), and columns correspond to features of these instances.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e855067a1d281ca6634772513ef918aa1c9224f4","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\npd.set_option(\"display.precision\", 2)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e3ae8b8d09f0dd881831253957ca96d086038f7b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We'll demonstrate the main methods in action by analyzing a [dataset](https://bigml.com/user/francisco/gallery/dataset/5163ad540c0b5e5b22000383) on the churn rate of telecom operator clients.

This number, 85.8%, that we got through this very simple reasoning serves as a good starting point (*baseline*) for the further machine learning models that we will build. \n\nAs we move on in this course, recall that, before the advent of machine learning, the data analysis process looked something like this. Let's recap what we've covered:\n    \n- The share of loyal clients in the sample is 85.5%. The most naive model that always predicts a \"loyal customer\" on such data will guess right in about 85.5% of all cases. That is, the proportion of correct answers (*accuracy*) of subsequent models should be no less than this number, and will hopefully be significantly higher;\n- With the help of a simple forecast that can be expressed by the following formula: \"International plan = True & Customer Service calls > 3 => Churn = 1, else Churn = 0\", we can expect a guessing rate of 85.8%, which is just above 85.5%. Subsequently, we'll talk about decision trees and figure out how to find such rules **automatically** based only on the input data;\n- We got these two baselines without applying machine learning, and they'll serve as the starting point for our subsequent models. If it turns out that with enormous effort, we increase the share of correct answers by 0.5% per se, then possibly we are doing something wrong, and it suffices to confine ourselves to a simple model with two conditions;\n- Before training complex models, it is recommended to manipulate the data a bit, make some plots, and check simple assumptions. Moreover, in business applications of machine learning, they usually start with simple solutions and then experiment with more complex ones.\n\n## 3.
