We do preliminary checks and analysis using graphics and tables to summarize the data and leave out the less important details. It is much more convenient for us, humans, to grasp the main points this way than by reading many lines of raw data. It is amazing how much insight can be gained from seemingly simple charts created with available visualization tools.\n\nNext, when we analyze the performance of a model or report results, we also often use charts and images. Sometimes, for interpreting a complex model, we need to project high-dimensional spaces onto more visually intelligible 2D or 3D figures.\n\nAll in all, visualization is a relatively fast way to learn something new about your data. Thus, it is vital to learn its most useful techniques and make them part of your everyday ML toolbox.\n\nIn this article, we are going to get hands-on experience with visual exploration of data using popular libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib` and `seaborn`."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d156b8e53391462770beb393381e751e4ae01ebc"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Article outline\n\n1.

Univariate visualization\n\n*Univariate* analysis looks at one feature at a time. When we analyze a feature independently, we are usually mostly interested in the *distribution of its values* and ignore other features in the dataset.\n\nBelow, we will consider different statistical types of features and the corresponding tools for their individual visual analysis.\n\n#### 2.1 Quantitative features\n\n*Quantitative features* take on ordered numerical values. Those values can be *discrete*, like integers, or *continuous*, like real numbers, and usually express a count or a measurement.\n\n##### Histograms and density plots\n\nThe easiest way to take a look at the distribution of a numerical variable is to plot its *histogram* using the `DataFrame`'s method [`hist()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.hist.html)."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f7b176382e5d79e028fcc46809a06ad92b5363e8","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"features = ['Total day minutes', 'Total intl calls']\ndf[features].hist(figsize=(10, 4));","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"462eba4ccb56130d3152c44e17a48536576f1662"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"A histogram groups values into *bins* of equal value range.

Knowing the distribution of the feature values becomes important when you use Machine Learning methods that assume a particular type (most often Gaussian).\n\nIn the above plot, we see that the variable *Total day minutes* is normally distributed, while *Total intl calls* is prominently skewed right (its tail is longer on the right).\n\nThere is also another, often clearer, way to grasp the distribution: *density plots* or, more formally, *Kernel Density Plots*. They can be considered a [smoothed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_smoother) version of the histogram. Their main advantage over the latter is that they do not depend on the size of the bins.

Its components are a *box* (obviously, this is why it is called a *box plot*), the so-called *whiskers*, and a number of individual points (*outliers*).\n\nThe box by itself illustrates the interquartile spread of the distribution; its length is determined by the $25th \\, (\\text{Q1})$ and $75th \\, (\\text{Q3})$ percentiles. The vertical line inside the box marks the median ($50\\%$) of the distribution. \n\nThe whiskers are the lines extending from the box. They represent the entire scatter of data points, specifically the points that fall within the interval $(\\text{Q1} - 1.5 \\cdot \\text{IQR}, \\text{Q3} + 1.5 \\cdot \\text{IQR})$, where $\\text{IQR} = \\text{Q3} - \\text{Q1}$ is the [interquartile range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range).\n\nOutliers that fall outside of the range bounded by the whiskers are plotted individually as black points along the central axis.\n\nWe can see that a large number of international calls is quite rare in our data.\n\n##### Violin plot\n\nThe last type of distribution plots that we will consider is a *violin plot*.\n\nLook at the figures below.

If the values of a categorical variable are ordered, it is called *ordinal*.\n\n##### Frequency table\n\nLet's check the class balance in our dataset by looking at the distribution of the target variable: the *churn rate*. First, we will get a frequency table, which shows how frequent each value of the categorical variable is.

The easiest way to create it is to use the `seaborn`'s function [`countplot()`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.countplot.html). There is another function in `seaborn` that is somewhat confusingly called [`barplot()`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.barplot.html) and is mostly used for representation of some basic statistics of a numerical variable grouped by a categorical feature.\n\nLet's plot the distributions for two categorical variables:"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"da9afe36d6e11b6421f688ab088d34598bdec03e","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"_, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2, figsize=(12, 4))\n\nsns.countplot(x='Churn', data=df, ax=axes[0]);\nsns.countplot(x='Customer service calls', data=df, ax=axes[1]);","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"4473bb524a82d4519943f9ba2a133940a0fcf57e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"While the histograms, discussed above, and bar plots may look similar, there are several differences between them:\n1. *Histograms* are best suited for looking at the distribution of numerical variables while *bar plots* are used for categorical features.\n2.

The *histogram*'s X-axis is a *Cartesian coordinate axis* along which values cannot be changed; the ordering of the *bars* is not predefined. Still, it is useful to note that the bars are often sorted by height, that is, the frequency of the values. Also, when we consider *ordinal* variables (like *Customer service calls* in our data), the bars are usually ordered by variable value.\n\nThe left chart above vividly illustrates the imbalance in our target variable. The bar plot for *Customer service calls* on the right gives a hint that the majority of customers resolve their problems in maximum 2-3 calls. But, as we want to be able to predict the minority class, we may be more interested in how the fewer dissatisfied customers behave. It may well be that the tail of that bar plot contains most of our churn. These are just hypotheses for now, so let's move on to some more interesting and powerful visual techniques."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d5e0f1b2d5996a4263224ae2f1f0f828dc8cf93d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3.

Perhaps they are unhappy with the tariffs, so a possible measure to prevent churn could be a reduction in call rates. The company will need to undertake additional economic analysis to find out whether such measures would be beneficial.\n\nWhen we want to analyze a quantitative variable in two categorical dimensions at once, there is a suitable function for this in the `seaborn` library called [`catplot()`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.factorplot.html). For example, let's visualize the interaction between *Total day minutes* and two categorical variables in the same plot:"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"1b818c950a6e1e7a6321dd7b8b30c579fe677b17","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.catplot(x='Churn', y='Total day minutes', col='Customer service calls',\n               data=df[df['Customer service calls'] < 8], kind=\"box\",\n               col_wrap=4, height=3, aspect=.8);","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"882438bba571c46be658cb029c474f1e110bf3a4"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"From this, we could conclude that, starting with 4 calls, *Total day minutes* may no longer be the main factor for customer churn.

We have already seen its distribution with a *count plot*. Now, we are interested in the relationship between this ordinal feature and the target variable *Churn*.\n\nLet's look at the distribution of the number of calls to customer service, again using a *count plot*.

It shows a multivariate frequency distribution of categorical variables in tabular form. In particular, it allows us to see the distribution of one variable conditional on the other by looking along a column or row.\n\nLet's try to see how *Churn* is related to the categorical variable *State* by creating a cross tabulation:"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"928f649db2858b00f820e8eabae9a7e54070c286","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"pd.crosstab(df['State'], df['Churn']).T","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"5053f5af9b05d67338f6852dc3805e45ece89248"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In the case of *State*, the number of distinct values is rather high: 51.

But, what if we want to display all the features and still be able to interpret the resulting visualization?\n\nWe could use `hist()` or create a scatterplot matrix with `pairplot()` for the whole dataset to look at all of our features simultaneously.

Each of them can be considered as a dimension in the space of data points. Consequently, more often than not, we deal with high-dimensional datasets, where entire visualization is quite hard.\n\nTo look at a dataset as a whole, we need to decrease the number of dimensions used in visualization without losing much information about the data. This task is called *dimensionality reduction* and is an example of an *unsupervised learning* problem because we need to derive new, low-dimensional features from the data itself, without any supervised input.\n\nOne of the well-known dimensionality reduction methods is *Principal Component Analysis* (PCA), which we will study later in this course. Its limitation is that it is a *linear* algorithm that implies certain restrictions on the data.\n\nThere are also many non-linear methods, collectively called *Manifold Learning*.

Its math is also impressive (we will not delve into it here, but, if you feel brave, here is the [original article](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume9/vandermaaten08a/vandermaaten08a.pdf) by Laurens van der Maaten and Geoffrey Hinton from [JMLR](http://www.jmlr.org/)). Its basic idea is simple: find a projection for a high-dimensional feature space onto a plane (or a 3D hyperplane, but it is almost always 2D) such that those points that were far apart in the initial n-dimensional space will end up far apart on the plane. Those that were originally close would remain close to each other.\n\nEssentially, *neighbor embedding* is a search for a new and less-dimensional data representation that preserves neighborship of examples.\n\nNow, let's do some practice.

The [implementation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html) in `scikit-learn` is unlikely to be feasible in a real task. If you have a large number of samples, you should try [Multicore-TSNE](https://github.com/DmitryUlyanov/Multicore-TSNE) instead.\n- The plot can change a great deal depending on the random seed, which complicates interpretation. [Here](http://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/) is a good tutorial on t-SNE. In general, you shouldn't make any far-reaching conclusions based on such graphs because it can equate to plain guessing. Of course, some findings in t-SNE pictures can inspire an idea and be confirmed through more thorough research down the line, but that does not happen very often.\n\nOccasionally, using t-SNE, you can get a really good intuition for the data.
